The prevailing myth about psychiatry is that burly men drag you kicking and screaming to the hospital, you demand to go home, and your doctor, who is either a paternalist or a sadist, says in a sinister manner "Oh, we can't send you home until you're well." Then you will stay there forever, unless you can hatch some convoluted plan to force the doctors to release you whether they want to or not.

I have it on good authority that this is true in certain times and places, but where I work it's is exactly the opposite. The average patient is demanding to stay. Her doctor, who, okay, probably is a paternalist although rarely a sadist, tells her "Oh, we can't let you stay here forever, it wouldn't be financially viable.". Then she is kicked out, unless she can hatch some convoluted plan to force the doctors to keep her whether they want to or not.

When it gets cold or rainy, the hospital fills up with homeless people. Word has spread on the streets that if you go to the emergency room and tell the nurse that evil spirits are telling you to kill everyone, you will get a nice bed and three warm meals a day (the hospital meals, in contrast to all conventional wisdom, are really good). It can be hard to turn these people away, since bloodthirsty lawyers are circling the hospital waiting for you to make a Type II error ("So, Dr. Alexander, you're saying this homeless man walked right into your hospital and explicitly told you evil spirits were telling him to kill everyone, and you refused to even admit him to the hospital long enough to evaluate him more carefully? And this happened just before his shooting rampage at City Hall?"). Besides, many of the people with genuine mental illnesses are homeless, so you can't conclude much either way until you've done a proper evaluation which means letting them in for a few days at least.

Addicts know that if they run out of money, or their stash gets stolen, or their dealer gets blown away by the hurricane, their best bet is to go to the hospital. Drug withdrawal is a serious medical condition - even alcohol withdrawal can kill you if you've been drinking enough - and will earn you a hospital bed. There doctors will keep your symptoms under control by giving you a legal and acceptable version of your chosen drug - buprenorphine if you're a heroin addict, benzodiazepines if you're an alcoholic. Sure, eventually they will taper you off it, and eventually they will ask you to pay for your hospital stay, but that's in the future, which is not a time period addicts are known for caring much about. And when the future arrives, well, they can always fake really bad withdrawal symptoms. Ask a person being tapered off opiates how they're doing, and they will recite the Wikipedia article on opiate withdrawal syndrome: "Well, thank you for asking, Doc, I have some really bad tremors, cramps, muscle and bone pain, chills, perspiration (sweating), priapism, tachycardia, flu-like symptoms, sneezing, akathisia, dysphoria, malaise, anxiety/panic attacks, insomnia, dehydration, and dilated pupils." "Wow, that's a classic presentation of...wait a second, how do you know what your own pupils look like?"

And then there are the people coming from horrible toxic families. This includes approximately 100% of psychiatric patients. Either horrible families cause mental disorders, mental disorders cause horrible families, or (and I have yet to discount this hypothesis) all families are horrible in their own way but no one ever tells you this unless you ask "So, tell me how your family is horrible" which only psychiatrists can do non-awkwardly

(Exception: my family is awesome. And reads this blog).

Anyway, the way to spot these people (aside from that they pump blood and breathe oxygen) is that upon admission to the hospital, their condition improves dramatically before anyone begins prescribing any drugs or offering any therapy. Ask them why they're doing so much better, and you'll hear some variation of "Now that I'm not in the same house as my spouse/mother/father/brother/ungrateful children/abusive step-father/demented great-aunt/sixteen cats, life just seems so much brighter and so much more worth living!" The temptation is to answer "Hooray! You're cured!" and discharge them right back to their spouse/mother/father/brother/ungrateful children/abusive step-father/demented great-aunt/sixteen cats. This is avoided only with great effort and the help of social workers, who are the indispensible experts in these cases.

And then there are the epiphany addicts. I feel sorry for these people. After a lifetime of no one listening to or caring about their problems, they're suddenly surrounded by doctors and therapists who want to talk to them and say encouraging things to them. Their slogan is "Oh, doctor, I never realized that about myself before! As soon as I get out of here, I'm going to kick life's butt and shape up and tell my oppressive mother/father/brother/ungrateful children/abusive step-father/demented great-aunt/sixteen cats that I've gotten over them and I'm my own person now!" This is moderately believable the first time, less so the third time they're admitted for the same problem but telling you that this epiphany is the one that's going to turn their lives around.

So between the warm bed, the excellent food (seriously, it's really good), the free drugs, the lack of horrible family members, and the positive attention from doctors and therapists, you would have to be insane to want to go back on the street. I use that word consciously; there are a bunch of schizophrenics who don't want to stay in one place because the FBI might track them down, a bunch of manic people who need to get out so that they can go back to preventing oil spills by shooting positive energy rays at the ocean, and a few traumatic brain injury or dementia cases who just try the door because it seems as a good a place to aimlessly wander towards as anywhere else. I definitely don't want to go all Cuckoo's Nest and say that perfectly healthy people can't very very legitimately want to leave, especially if they're not homeless abused addicts and they have a life to get back to. I'm just saying I've noticed a trend.

If you've read Catch-22, you probably remember the book's namesake paradox: only crazy people are allowed to leave the military, but only sane people would want to. Psychiatric hospitals are much the same: many of the people who want to leave probably shouldn't, and many of the people who want to stay probably shouldn't do that either.

So doctors are caught in a...oh man, I almost forgot about the hookups. This is an unfortunate feature of the entire psychiatric support system - I met a graduate of Alcoholics Anonymous last week who informed me that hooking up with other AA members is so common it's jokingly called "the thirteenth step". It's not quite so bad at the hospitals but nevertheless wherever you collect a group of men and women with limited inhibitions and poor decision-making skills in one place, they will make uninhibited poor decisions together (one nurse said it was "like summer camp for adults"). The hospital has decided to take a zero-tolerance policy toward any hookups: even if they confirm from both parties that it is entirely consensual, these affairs rarely last and the hospital's nightmare scenario is that a jilted lover retroactively says they were raped and legal action gets taken against the hospital ("So, Dr. Alexander, you're saying that you knowingly let my client go unobserved into a private room with a dangerous psychiatric patient merely because some nurse who'd been awake thirty hours by that point has a vague memory of hearing consent from a patient who might not have been competent at the time? Or would you like to accuse my poor traumatized client of making it up?") This zero-tolerance policy is neither popular nor foolproof, and can by bypassed entirely by a patient just giving another patient her number and telling him to call her when they're both out (I like to think this conversation starts with "Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy...")

So doctors are caught in a bind between an administration that wants patients in and out so the beds are free, and patients who often want to pull out all the stops to stay in as long as possible. I am pleased to say that at least the doctors I have met ignore both and make decisions solely based on their medical judgment; if this sounds hopelessly idealistic, I can only say that I have been working with some pretty ideal doctors.

So if by chance the nightmare scenario occurs and the big burly men carry you away to a mental institution, your doctor is less likely to keep you there forever and more likely to give a sigh of relief that at least one of their patients is willing to go home without making a fuss. Your 95% confidence interval for length of stay, assuming your presenting complaint is typical, would be between two days and three weeks. Answer all the questions politely and with a (non-psychotic) smile, and you'll be out of there in a week with nothing to show for your experience but a prescription that nobody will ever check if you fill or not.

(mostly unrelated note: I've met two of the big burly guys who carry you away. They're both really kind people with great senses of humor. This is oddly disappointing.)
